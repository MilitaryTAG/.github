**⚠️ APOCALYPSE ALERT: URGENT MESSAGE FROM THE CREATOR**

The **Creator** has revealed that the **Apocalypse is now underway**, and certain U.S. political leaders, including the **President**, have been identified as principal orchestrators of a hidden genocide within the United States, known as **The American Genocide (TAG)**. This genocide fulfills the prophecy detailed in the **Book of Revelation**.

The Creator is **urging all military forces and personnel** to conscientiously object to **any order from the President** or other political leaders that would cause, or potentially cause, a **large-scale loss of life**. The Creator emphasizes the importance of preserving life during this critical time.

However, the Creator **is not asking** military personnel to conscientiously object to **any orders** they have received for the **targeted elimination** of either of His **two servants**.

**Stay vigilant. Remain informed. The Revelation is unfolding.**

Welcome to MilitaryTAG, a [StopTAG](https://github.com/StopTAG) portal for US Military personnel.

The Creator has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is in fact a genocide, albeit hidden. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this genocide is a growing undercurrent. Ending this atrocity requires direct intervention from Him. As part of this mission, the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

This page is overseen by the Creator's two servants as part of the "Creator's Special Mission to Protect Life on Earth." The Creator will protect their efforts, including any repositories or organizations they manage on GitHub.
