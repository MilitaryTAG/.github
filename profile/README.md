### Welcome to Your True Mission

#### Introducing the Creator

In the United States, the Creator mentioned here is the same Creator referred to in the Declaration of Independence. Most Americans call Him God. Remember to always use a capital "C" in Creator and a capital "G" in God. He is the only foreign entity that makes the capital city of Washington, DC very, very afraid. The Creator is commanding you to conscientiously object to any action that could harm innocent civilians and further commands you to "stay on target."

#### Meet Kelvin Eugene Williams

I am Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, recognized as an "angel" in most belief systems. I was born on Earth for this mission. I am American by birth, and Southern by the grace of God. Wherever we go, our mission remains the same: to protect creation (life itself) and uphold God's glory, although the latter task is rarely required. My initial mission was to eliminate the top three causes of death in humans, but the Creator has redirected my focus to address another emerging cause of death in humans that often goes unnoticed: world governments. Here in the United States, our own government has deployed you to prevent me from reporting on something they have no intention of stopping or informing the public about: The American Genocide (TAG).

This genocide has left me with no true friends or blood relatives that I know, or can confirm, are still alive. It has claimed the lives of people I just met and spoke to in public, as well as thousands whom I've never laid eyes upon and who didn't know me at allâ€”in the church massacres.

#### Understanding TAG

TAG, originally standing for "The AIDS-cure Genocide," was initially orchestrated by Gilead Sciences and executed by the CIA. Its objective was to prevent a gift from above that eradicates and prevents all disease (with the exception of conditions that are the result of organ misfunction) from reaching the hands of everyone. Initially, its victims primarily consisted of friends and family members of the Creator's two servants. However, as TAG evolved, the acronym shifted to "The American Genocide," reflecting the inclusion of John Q. and Jane Q. Public victims, particularly after the Sandy Hook massacre, the Orr Chapel Tragedy, and the Mount Calvary Baptist Church massacre. TAG now poses a severe threat not only to human life but also to the American way of life, as it is now being exploited by the political elite to establish an authoritarian regime in the United States.

#### TAG-POW Attacks
TAG-POW (The American Genocide - Places of Worship) attacks involve coordinated denial of access to 911 by the CIA and FBI, surprise attacks, execution-style killings of congregants in places of worship, and the operatives vanishing as quickly as they came, eliminating all physical evidence. The now technically "missing" murder victims (whose bodies are illegally disposed of) have their assets plundered in a large-scale identity manipulation scheme that leaves the murdered victims alive "on paper."

The property owned by these churches is being used by the CIA to lure in new victims in Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs). These include fake funerals announced for victims killed at the church in an earlier act by the perpetrators, fake religious services (e.g., Sunday morning worship), and non-religious events like Halloween parties for kids, hair shows, and Super Bowl viewing parties. Around the world, entering a place of worship is considered one of the safest activities one can do. In these very same places now occupied by the CIA, merely stepping onto the property means death for those not there to work (murdering others).

#### Mount Calvary Baptist Church Massacre

Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY, was a predominantly black congregation. The CIA attacked this church to prevent me from proving that my family was massacred and my mother was being impersonated. The congregation was systematically killed, and the incident was covered up. The federal government went as far as to hire people who resemble my family members to perpetuate the lie.

#### Hickory Valley Christian Church Massacre

Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN, was an all-white congregation. After receiving an email from me about the Mount Calvary massacre, they verified the information themselves and became cautious. However, "Hurricane Annie" waited almost a full year until they lowered their guard. On Mother's Day, the CIA attacked the church while a conference call was in progress, ensuring no one survived. This incident remains unknown to most operatives due to the extensive cover-up.

#### The Threat of Authoritarianism

The Creator vehemently opposes authoritarianism. TAG is designed to strip Americans of self-governance, replacing democracy with authoritarian rule. The deployment of military personnel to eliminate me is a political move to prevent the exposure of these atrocities.

#### A Call to Conscience

The Creator knows you have been lied to and He is furious. He commands you to use your intelligence to confirm these events. Verify the massacres, the cover-ups, and the infiltration of the CIA in your own mind and actions. Refuse to harm innocent civilians and stay on the path of truth and justice.
